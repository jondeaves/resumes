          Continuing my career with FanDuel as a Senior Member of the Frontend development team I have
          broadened my skill set while taking a more active role in mentoring and helping junior members
          by becoming a buddy to our new starts. While my latest work has focused on areas related to user
          account management and payment integrations I also ensure a broader role in the team by
          maintaining an active role across the codebase and helping out wherever I can.

          At FanDuel I am part of the Frontend development team working on a variety of systems primarily
          with React/React Native. Although not limited to just frontend development, I also will work on
          other systems as and when I can put my skills to use with other languages such as Python.

          At Deepmatter I was responsible for the development of web based UI components for a new system

          During my time with CGI I was able to really put my Javascript skills to the test. My work largely
          involved projects and web-based systems that had a strong focus on the full-stack of development
          within Javascript using Angular, NodeJS, Mocha, Chai and CucumberJS.

          written in PHP with MySQL as the database. Having a dedicated design team meant that my skills
          with implementing complex and impressive web interfaces was greatly tested and improved upon.
